If your Operating System understands how to start a runnable jarfile, just double click.

If it doesn't, run it from a command prompt/terminal using the command:
	
	java -jar MJ.jar

There are several runtime parameters that can be passed in the for of an extra "--value":

	--help		Show this help text
	--nodebug		Does not add the debug text pane to the UI
	--nohuman		All players are A.I. This means you cannot see any tiles.
	--autoplay		Human's hand is played by an A.I. player instead.
	--playopen		Everyone plays with open tiles.
	--editor		Run the config pattern editor instead of the game
	
These values can be combined, so to run the game without a debug window, autoplaying
with everyone's tiles visible, run:

	java -jar MJ.jar --nodebug --autoplay --playopen
