This is still very much a beta version, so the instructions are relatively simple:

Always full-click on a tile face. Java is not the most spectacular mouse event handler, so
if you do a quick click, it might actually not register. Also, mouse handling is not defined
outside them, and can have unpredictable results. To order your tiles, middle click on any
one of your concealed tiles.


- To play a tile from your hand, left-click that tile, or navigate to the tile with your left/right cursor keys, then hit "space"

- To claim a tile form someone else, left-click on their discarded tile, or just hit "enter" on your keyboard.

- To pass over someone's discard, right-click on their discarded tile, or press "space".
  (This can considerable speed up the game!)

- If you picked your own winning tile, click the "declare win" button on the left.
  This will pop up a "do you want to claim a self-draw win" dialog.
